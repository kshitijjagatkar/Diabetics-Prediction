# Diabetics-Prediction
Without using Scikit learn library.

## Overview

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. I collected this data from kaggle, for the link click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)

## Curiosity

I choose this data for predicting if a person has a diabetes or not but without using any Machine Learning library. I was having a curiosity of solving this problem by using mathematics and the data analysis libraries. Achieving the great accuracy is not my goal here but to chase the curiosity.

## Files and Installation

there one jupyter notebook file which contains all of the code. You will need a platform(Anaconda) to run a jupyter nootbook file and a browser.
